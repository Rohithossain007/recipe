        <h2>How to Cook a Turkey</h2>
        <p>You'll be glad to know that cooking a turkey is surprisingly easy. Even with just a</p>
        <p>little bit of prep, you'll get great results you can be proud of. Here's how to</p>
        <p>prepare a thawed turkey for roasting in the oven:</p>

        <h2>Step 1:Prep the turkey </h2>
        <p>Unwrap the plastic around your turkey over the sink to ensure that any juices</p>
        <p>will run down the drain. Remove the packet of giblets from the cavity of the bird</p>
        <p>and save them for <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-make-turkey-gravy-from-drippings/">gravy</a> or <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/976/holidays-and-events/thanksgiving/side-dishes/stuffing-and-dressing/">stuffing</a>. Next, use paper towels to pat dry the bird</p>
        <p>inside and out.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Stuff the Turkey (Optional)</h2>
        <p>If you are stuffing the turkey, stuff it loosely, allowing about ½ to ¾ cup stuffing</p>
        <p>per pound of turkey. While stuffing a turkey is traditional (and picturesque), it</p>
        <p>has become less and less common over the years for a number of reasons. Most</p>
        <p>importantly, cooking your stuffing to 165 degrees F likely means that you'll over-</p>
        <p>cook the rest of the bird.</p>
        <p>"If you don't want to miss out on stuffing, it's much easier (and safer) to "
            <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-make-stuffing/">prepare </p><p>the stuffing</a> in a separate baking dish instead of the bird's cavity.

        <h2>
            Step 3: Truss the Turkey
        </h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of trussing is to ensure that the bird will cook as evenly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the legs are not secured tightly, more air will be able to circulate around them 
        </p>
        <p>
            in the oven, which will cause them to cook more quickly. This can eventually 
        </p>
        <p>
            lead to portions of the bird becoming over-cooked, while other portions aren't  
        </p>
        <p>
            quite there.

        <h6>PHOTO:SARA TANE</h6>
        <p>Tie the drumsticks together with kitchen twine, and brush the skin with melted</p>
        <p>butter or oil. If you don't have kitchen twine, you can opt to truss with</p>
        <p>(unflavored) dental floss or even use the turkey's skin to fold the legs tightly</p>
        <p>together. While you're trussing, make sure to tuck the wings behind the back of</p>
        <p>the turkey. If they're exposed, they will burn quickly in the oven.</p>
