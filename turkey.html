        <h2>How to Cook a Turkey</h2>
        <p>You'll be glad to know that cooking a turkey is surprisingly easy. Even with just a</p>
        <p>little bit of prep, you'll get great results you can be proud of. Here's how to</p>
        <p>prepare a thawed turkey for roasting in the oven:</p>

        <h2>Step 1:Prep the turkey </h2>
        <p>Unwrap the plastic around your turkey over the sink to ensure that any juices</p>
        <p>will run down the drain. Remove the packet of giblets from the cavity of the bird</p>
        <p>and save them for <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-make-turkey-gravy-from-drippings/">gravy</a> or <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/976/holidays-and-events/thanksgiving/side-dishes/stuffing-and-dressing/">stuffing</a>. Next, use paper towels to pat dry the bird</p>
        <p>inside and out.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Stuff the Turkey (Optional)</h2>
        <p>If you are stuffing the turkey, stuff it loosely, allowing about ½ to ¾ cup stuffing</p>
        <p>per pound of turkey. While stuffing a turkey is traditional (and picturesque), it</p>
        <p>has become less and less common over the years for a number of reasons. Most</p>
        <p>importantly, cooking your stuffing to 165 degrees F likely means that you'll over-</p>
        <p>cook the rest of the bird.</p>
        <p>"If you don't want to miss out on stuffing, it's much easier (and safer) to "
            <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-make-stuffing/">prepare </p><p>the stuffing</a> in a separate baking dish instead of the bird's cavity.

        <h2>
            Step 3: Truss the Turkey
        </h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of trussing is to ensure that the bird will cook as evenly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the legs are not secured tightly, more air will be able to circulate around them 
        </p>
        <p>
            in the oven, which will cause them to cook more quickly. This can eventually 
        </p>
        <p>
            lead to portions of the bird becoming over-cooked, while other portions aren't  
        </p>
        <p>
            quite there.

        <h6>PHOTO:SARA TANE</h6>
        <p>Tie the drumsticks together with kitchen twine, and brush the skin with melted</p>
        <p>butter or oil. If you don't have kitchen twine, you can opt to truss with</p>
        <p>(unflavored) dental floss or even use the turkey's skin to fold the legs tightly</p>
        <p>together. While you're trussing, make sure to tuck the wings behind the back of</p>
        <p>the turkey. If they're exposed, they will burn quickly in the oven.</p>

        <h2>Step 4:Roast The Turkey</h2>
        <p>Place the bird on a rack in a roasting pan, and into a preheated, 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven (or follow your recipe's instructions). To enhance the gravy you'll likely make with the turkey's drippings, place aromatics and herbs below the roasting rack, such as carrots, onion, celery, garlic, rosemary, and sage. As the turkey cooks, drippings will coat these aromatics for a savory, flavor-packed sauce. You can add some stock and white wine to the aromatics as the turkey cooks to deglaze the roasting pan.

        <h6>PHOTO: SARA TANE</h6>
        <p>Roast until the skin is a light golden color, then cover the breast loosely with a foil tent to prevent further browning. During the last 45 minutes of baking, remove the foil tent to brown the skin. Basting is not necessary, but it helps to promote even browning. As the turkey approaches the end of its cook time, check the temperature of your bird with an instant read thermometer. The breast should be 155 degrees F (it will continue to cook while it rests) and the thigh should hit 165 degrees F. If the turkey is done, transfer it to a clean sheet pan and tent with foil.</p>

        <h2>Step 5: Serve the Turkey</h2>
        <p>Be sure to allow at least 30 minutes between the time you take the turkey out of the oven and when you serve it. The turkey needs to "rest" for 20 to 30 minutes (you can use that resting time to warm up your Thanksgiving side dishes and make the gravy), and then you can carve your turkey. Carve away the breasts, then carefully slice them, keeping the golden brown skin intact. Next, carve away the legs, separating the thighs and drumstick at the ligament.

        <p><strong>Serving Top:</strong> Warm your serving platter in the oven for about five minutes before you put the sliced turkey on it. You've put in too much work to serve cold turkey!</p>
